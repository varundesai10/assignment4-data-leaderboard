# CS336 Spring 2025 Assignment 4 (Data) Leaderboard

To submit to the leaderboard, submit a pull request that adds your results to
the Markdown table below. The table should be sorted by increasing loss.

The top 3 submissions will receive a prize at the end of the quarter.
To make this fair, we will reorder the top 5 scoring students based on our reproduced training runs.
**Make sure you save a snapshot of your best data pipeline so it can be reproduced by us!**
We will reach out to the top 5 students after results have stabilized.

In your pull request description, you should include:

- The final validation loss that was recorded
- A link to an associated learning curve that clearly shows a wallclock-time.
  You may either upload an image directly
  to the repo (use the [./images](./images)) folder or link to a
  publicly-viewable plot from a service like Weights and Biases.
- A description of what you did
